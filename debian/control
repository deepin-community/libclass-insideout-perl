Description: safe, simple inside-out object construction kit
 Class::InsideOut is a simple, safe and streamlined toolkit for building
 inside-out objects. Unlike most other inside-out object building modules
 already on CPAN, this module aims for minimalism and robustness:
 .
   * Does not require derived classes to subclass it
   * Uses no source filters, attributes or CHECK blocks
   * Supports any underlying object type including black-box inheritance
   * Does not leak memory on object destruction
   * Overloading-safe
   * Thread-safe for Perl 5.8.5 or better
   * mod_perl compatible
   * Makes no assumption about inheritance or initializer needs
 .
 It provides the minimal support necessary for creating safe inside-out
 objects and generating flexible accessors.
